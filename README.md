Data Collector, a graphic tool meticulously crafted for efficient company data gathering, reflects my commitment to streamlining information processes. Upon activation on a machine, users seamlessly input data via the intuitive interface. The tool then processes and compiles the data, delivering a comprehensive output conveniently stored in a CSV file within the same directory. This design not only enhances user experience but also optimizes data management for increased accessibility and usability.
